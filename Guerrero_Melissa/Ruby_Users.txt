rails new user_login_project

cd user_login_project

gem install hirb

rails g model User first_name:string last_name:string email_address:string age:integer

rake db:migrate

rails c

had to manually enter new users because User.create didn't work no matter which way I tried :(
	user1 = User.new
	user1[:first_name] = "Violet" etc.
	user1.save

User.all brought back the users I had created

Had trouble with Hirb.enable...Ken helped with vim Gemfile, bundle, then back to rails c

created a validations list in user.rb
tested it with a user = User.new()
then ran user.save which returned false
then ran user.errors.full_mesages to see why it had returned false

To retrieve all users type User.all
To retrieve first user type User.first
To retrieve last user type User.last

To get users sorted by their first name, type User.order(:first_name)

To get the record of the user whose id is 3, and update the person's last
name to something else, type
User.update(3, last_name: "Pumpkin")

To destroy a record of a user with id 4, type User.find(4).destroy
